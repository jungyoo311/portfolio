# Welcome to Jung's Portfolio!

This repository showcases a collection of my projects in computer vision and machine learning.

Overview
* `EmojiDetect`: A project focused on real-time emoji detection from facial expressions.
* `Inverse_Perspective_Mapping`: Implementation of Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM) to transform images from perspective view to a bird's-eye view.
* `Truck-Safety`: A project dedicated to improving truck safety through advanced computer vision techniques.
* `traffic_sign`: An exploration into traffic sign recognition and classification using deep learning.
* `YOLO_BEV_Simulation`: A simulation environment for object detection using YOLO in a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) perspective.
* `Happy-Lens`: A fun project that uses computer vision to detect smiles and apply visual effects.
* `portfolio`: This repository itself, serving as a central hub for my work.
